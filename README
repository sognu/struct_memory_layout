*************************************
Examines the memory layout of structs
*************************************


Makefile	- For building and cleaning proxy
README		- This file

# Proxy source files
struct.{c,h}	- Primary proxy code
funcs.{h}	- Functions to implement
main.{c}        - Unit tests

To run:
       make
       ./struct


*A discovery of this project was that bitfield structs may contain padding, and that the layout depended on the compiler(tested with gcc and clang).
